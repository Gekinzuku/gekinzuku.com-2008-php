<b>Description from Kayos:</b><br>
This pack was made by Nintendo-Revolutionized's moderator Kayos. I have been working on this pack for a while and thought I would release it to the 
public eye to show you my current progress. I was inspired to do this project with a friend a little while back and we have been working on this ever 
since. This game is a favorite to me and a lot of other people, so playing the game in High-Resolution should make the gaming experiance more realistic 
and get a better view. I guarantee you will be more satisfied with this then the original's resolution. This is an open source, Unfortunately. If you 
have any suggestions to make it better you can contact me at <a href="mailto:Kayos@nintendo-revolutionized.com">Kayos@nintendo-revolutionized.com</a>. 
One more thing, please do not say this is yours. That only pisses me off and makes me want to quit my pack. Anywho, enjoy the pack!<br><br>
