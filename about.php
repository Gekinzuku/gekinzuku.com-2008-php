<p><b>History of the name:</b> We initially named ourselves Geemusu(looks like: &#12466;&#12540;&#12512;&#12473;) which is a Japanese word for "Games". 
Gekinzuku(Pronounced: geh kin zoo koo) is actually a misspelling of this Japanese word. The misspelling is a result of Graham1 being too lazy to 
pronounce it the proper way and to Kori's dismay, soon Graham1 and GeekyLink completely forgot the proper way to pronounce the word. She sometimes still 
reminds us of our stupidity for doing so, but we don't think anyone will actually mind ;)</p>

<p><b>Our History:</b>
The three of us met about a year ago, to be precise I, GeekyLink, met Kori in
November06, and Graham in January07. I introduced them to each other 
about March that year. At first... Kori and Graham1 didn't get along very well to say the least. Eventually since I was friends with both of them they got 
used to each other. After that, everyone got along fine... most of the time, but that's another story LOL I decided to try my hand at some DS homebrew 
programming and I made a pong clone as my first project. I met another person, Ice1605, who cleaned the code up and motivated me to improve on the game a little.
I took a little break
from programming after that because I had other things on my mind at
the time, eventually Graham told me that we should start a little 
company like thing and
make some games. He proposed several ideas, so I started off on a
couple crappy ideas, finally sticking to a good one. I worked on the 
dang thing for ages by myself. Eventually dragging Graham1 and Kori into it. Next thing we knew we were working on a project together, Kori giving us the initial name, Geemusu!
