Hey, I decided to work on our hacking projects page, so now you can view a list of what all hacks we have, instead of being forced to stare at those annoying embedded videos, since we are aware that the embedded videos use a version of flash that some do not have. Now you can just click a link and something will come up, hopefully I'll throw in some fancy xhtml and whatnot as well ;)<br>
Just click the hacking projects link over to your right to check it out!

<a href="mailto:metroidluver13@aol.com">Kori</a> - <b>Announcement Of A New Side Project!</b> - May 15th 2008:<br>
Hi! While we have plenty of projects going on already, I don't really participate in any of them due to lack of... Well let's say "useable" applications. However, I am pleased to announce my own project. I would like to thank GeekyLink for helping me get started and for teaching me what I need to know. With his support I won't back down from what will be a large project.

<a href="mailto:GeekyLink@nintendo-revolutionized.com">GeekyLink</a> - <b>New Projects Coming Soon</b> - April 16th 2008:<br>
Hey guys. Large update here. First off, I wanted to let you guys know that I programmed a tiny little add-on to Gekinzuku so you can see how many people have downloaded each project. Sadly, I obviously cannot log how many people downloaded anything before I created this system. But you can see the game's popularity from now on out. On top of that I made a demo commenting system for Santa's Challenge. I'm also working on other useful add-ons for the site.
<br><br>
On to the actual projects! I just wanted to let everyone know that the rest of the staff and I have been working on a couple projects. We'll be showing off some of the stuff soon. I can't reveal too much about anything, but I can tell you that we have some impressive stuff coming soon. And even a new member to Gekinzuku. So keep up to date, you won't want to miss this. ;)<br><br>

<a href="mailto:Graham1@nintendo-revolutionized.com">Graham1</a> - <b>How is the section?</b> - February 9th 2008:<br>
GeekyLink and I were wondering how the Gekinzuku section is coming along. Right now we don't have much, but I've been messing around and I think I have some ideas as to putting things like HTML or browser games on here. I'll add a game section soon, but how do you think this section is going? Make some comments on it at the forums.<br><br>

<a href="mailto:geekylink@nintendo-revolutionized.com">GeekyLink</a> - <b>Santa's Challenge Takes Second</b> - January 22th 2008:<br>

<a href="mailto:geekylink@nintendo-revolutionized.com">GeekyLink</a> - <b>Update on Programming Contest</b> - January 18th 2008:<br>

Any questions or comments are appreciates, just post them on the <a href="http://www.nintendo-revolutionized.com/forums/index.php?topic=48">forums</a>.

<a href="mailto:geekylink@nintendo-revolutionized.com">GeekyLink</a> - <b>Site Look Finished</b> - January 15th 2008:<br>
Well I finally got around to organizing everything properly on the site, there may be a few useless files still but that's nothing of much concern to anyone.
In other news, I've been slowly reading more about programming junk that I'm interested in trying out. And I finally got Graham1 and Kori to actually read something about DS programming, so hopefully they'll be able to help more from here on out. I'm currently working on a live chat for the site, hopefully that'll be up soon. Feel free to look around, and go post on the forums if you have any questions! <br><br>

<a href="mailto:Graham1@nintendo-revolutionized.com">Graham1</a> - <b>Not Like We're Lazy...</b> - January 11th 2008:<br>
It's not like we're lazy, but we're still not done here yet. Maybe within a couple more weeks we'll be finished. GeekyLink, Kori, and I are all very, very busy. It doesn't help that the school semester has started up again. We'll be done eventually! Just hang on...<br><br>

<a href="mailto:Graham1@nintendo-revolutionized.com">Graham1</a> - <b>Gekinzuku Section Revamping</b> - January 3rd 2008:<br>
Hey everyone, we're revamping the Gekinzuku section to follow with the main page change. We'll probably have this new section done around the 4th or 5th of this month. Hope you can hang on until then!<br><br>

<a href="mailto:Graham1@nintendo-revolutionized.com">Graham1</a> - <b>Hang On A Little More...</b> - January 2nd 2008:<br>
Santa's Challenge is just about out! We are not sure of an exact date to release the project because the contest that it is entered in had their deadline move up. The new deadline is coming up, January 8th, and the project will be released shortly after, so just hang on a little more.... We hope you will like it!<br><br>
