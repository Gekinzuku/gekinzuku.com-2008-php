<h1>Graham1</h1>
<h3>The Name</h3>
Hey, I'm Graham1, also known as TriforceSavior on youtube (mainly due to lack of Graham1 being available), and I'm part of Gekinzuku, and I help run this site. I'm an administrator on the forums, as well as the site itself, and I help program/design a lot of this site along with GeekyLink, who really does the larger amount of work, and I also report some news on CuteNews every once and a while, mainly stories that interest me.<br>
<h3>My Main Job</h3>
So what I do around here as part of my life in Gekinzuku, is hack The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time with various programs, help GeekyLink test codes that he made himself, then use said codes, or make my own variants of his codes. Both of which are fun. I also program Nintendo DS games, it was hard work but I taught myself the language, considering I was brought into programming computers at age 10. It really gets fun when I get to program something, and then bring it to friends to show it off. I carry my DS on me almost all the time, it serves as my MP3 player, my Movie player, and my Gaming/Entertainment tool. Another thing I do is this, I mess with pages on the site; it's pretty fun actually, either fixing GeekyLink's grammar/spelling, or just changing things, I enjoy it.<br>
<h3>Our Team</h3>
GeekyLink, Kori, and I are all best friends. I've known GeekyLink for about one and a half years, and I've known Kori for about a year or so. We got this together a bit back when we decided that my mispronunciation on the word "Geemezu", which is Japanese for "Game" turned into Gekinzuku through my odd talent to not remember how to say something, then make it what I want. And supposedly, recently Kori pointed out even this word has a base off Japanese, no surprise actually.<br>
We plan to hit it big one day, either starting our own company in this name, or join Nintendo and get a good paying job making Zelda/Mario games. That really would be cool, you see games like Shadow The Hedgehog, where they shout Yuji Naka's (the director of the game) name in a point close to the end of the game in the challenge mode, and you think that maybe nobody would notice if you just hid your name in the game.<br>
<h3>GeekyLink</h3>
GeekyLink is one of our group, he's my best friend, and really someone you can talk to. We like to stay up until the late hours in the morning talking, then I might fall asleep at my computer, as he continues to talk to Kori. GeekyLink is actually a very innovative person, when you take ideas that I have, then his twists on them, it becomes quite a game! In fact, when I suggested making a Chip's Challenge for DS, he took the idea and said, "How about we make a game like Chip's Challenge, make it christmas themed, and enter it in that christmas compo!" Sure enough, we took second place in the contest, and made a bunch of cash. He really is an awesome person, he has actually been behind a lot of our Ocarina Of Time hacking recently, he made a couple GameShark code creators for it, and some videos (along with me) that show off our hacks. So yeah, one of my best friends, GeekyLink.<br>
