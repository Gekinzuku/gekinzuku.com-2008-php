<p align="left">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hello, this is GeekyLink. I am the main programmer and concept designer for Gekinzuku. Although our roles are rather interchangeable. I also am the main site 
designer and programmer. All in all, I'm a little busy! I have three years experience programming, the last two years I have used C and C++ as my main language of choice. Since
starting this website I obviously had to study a bit of PHP, and JS. Although it all came out well, we did manage to get this site up, didn't we?<br><br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I am not a professional programmer, but I hope to become a professional someday, and I consider this whole website and all 
of the projects as stepping stones to that goal. Our first true project, Santa's Challenge, was a great success, so we are looking forward to showing off 
more of our work.<br><br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Damn, this must be boring to read. Well I'll spare you the agony of reading pages upon pages of useless, boring, "nobody care!" type of information. LOL 
I just want to leave one small dedication. I really have to thank Kori for managing to keep me motivated to actually finish Santa's Challenge. Without her 
the project probably would've been scraped long ago, IF ever come to life! Thank you for reading this, now go try out our stuff and let us know what you think!</p>

<p><b>Dates of Importance:</b><br>As of January 22, 2008, I am pleased to announce that we placed 2nd in the "Third Annual Christmas Coding Competition". You can download 
Santa's Challenge <a href="/SC"/>here</a>. Enjoy!</p>
