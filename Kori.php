<center> Hi, I am the lead graphic artist for Gekinzuku, you can call me Kori. I do a bit of the coding too, 
but not much. I also did a bit of the website design as you can see on the home page of the site, but overall
thanks should go to GeekyLink for putting it all together into one piece.</center></p> 
<center> <h1><u> My History With Gekinzuku</u></h1> </center>

<center> It was about July in 2006 that I registered on Nsider (the original) forums. It was there that I met
a friend of GeekyLink, LINKSWORD2. LINKSWORD2 and I were friends, and eventually we made our own website that
no longer exists. LINKSWORD2 brought GeekyLink to the website as an administrator because we were so small and
in need of members. One day, on a website GeekyLink owned, I met his friend: Graham1. Graham1 and I did NOT get
along at first but soon we were all best friends. LINKSWORD2 is excluded because I got mad at him one day, and
deleted the website we shared. </p>

Then, almost a year later, GeekyLink got the idea to enter into a programming contest. He had no idea how to 
render graphics, so he asked me to do the sprite work and backgrounds. I became the lead graphic artist in 
the credits for the game "Santa's Challenge'". This is how Gekinzuku came about, though originally sought out 
to be Geemusu (sounds like games) Graham1 incessantly kept misspelling it Gekinzuku. With that, we got our name.</p>

I can be contacted at: metroidluver13(a)aol.com (my preferred address).
