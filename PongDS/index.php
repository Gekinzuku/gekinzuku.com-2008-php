<h2>Pong DS</h2> <br><br>

<p><b>Description:</b> These are a couple old roms that I, GeekyLink, programmed with my friend Ice1605.  This was actually my first project for the DS...
So they aren't the best, but feel free to play around with them. A special note is that on most emulators these roms run a little odd, specially it is the scoring system on the bottom screen. It is fine on actual hardware so if you can run them on the hardware I would recommend it. The only things I have edited since making them was by changing the web link, but you'll only see that if you play the rom on actual hardware.</p>

<p><b>Controls:</b> Paddle one is controlled by pressing up and down on the directional pad, and paddle two is controlled by the 'A' 
and 'B' buttons. It's not the best setup, I will admit, but that's just the way it was designed.  I hope you enjoy :P</p>


<p><b>Pong DS V 2.1:</b> <br>
<a href="Pong.c">Source code</a>&#160;
<a href="download.php">The pong rom </a> <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I coded it, but my friend Ice1605 is 
responsible for cleaning the code up so it looks better, and also 
he kinda got me to add a scoring system too.</p>

<p><b>Pong DS V 3.0:</b> <br>
<a href="Pong3.0.c">Source code</a>&#160;
<a href="download.php?version=3">The pong rom </a> <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Same as above; however, I added an extra funny mode to it, now you when the game starts you can select
either normal mode or crazy mode, if you pick the crazy mode every time you score your paddle will get 
smaller and the opponents will get bigger :o</p>
